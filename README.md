### Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Wilfried (aka Commodore64)
#### Fullstack Developer, Junior DevOps, Software Engineering Student
I enjoy learning languages and web development frameworks such as NextJS, NestJS, Python and C (the holy language), although my tech stack is a bit larger.
I also like algorithms, low level programming and task automation (and somehow automata theory).

- I'm currently learning Scala & DevOps ðŸš€.
- I write random stuff in C.
- I recently developed a CLI called [Quirgo](https://npmjs.com/package/quirgo).
