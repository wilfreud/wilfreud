### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Wilfried
#### Fullstack Developer, Software Engineering student
I enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React/NextJS, NestJS, Python and C, as well as DevOps tools like Docker.
I also like algorithms and tasks automation.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to learn DevOps and functional programming
- Writing random things in C to get to know how things actually work under the hood
